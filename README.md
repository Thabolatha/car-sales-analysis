# car-sales-analysis
This repository contains a detailed analysis of vehicle sales spanning multiple models, body types and regions. The objective of this project was to evaluate sales performance, understand market trends, and identify revenue and profitability drivers within the automotive dataset.

The dataset included key sales-related fields such as model names, selling prices, cost prices, fuel types, body classifications, regions, and sale dates. These allowed for a comprehensive review of sales behaviour and profitability dynamics.

Project Background

Automotive businesses rely heavily on accurate sales intelligence to inform pricing strategy, dealership performance evaluation, and stock planning. This project replicates such work by analysing historical car sales to produce insights that help in understanding demand cycles and strategic opportunities.

The analysis addresses questions such as:

Which models contribute most to revenue?

How profitable are various body types and fuel configurations?

Which regions perform stronger than others?

How does pricing change over time?
